## Getting the game
You can play the game on [itch.io](https://khooroko.itch.io/dog-mario) or get it from the newest [releases](https://github.com/khooroko/Dog-Mario/releases).

## Controls
Movement is done using the `WASD` or `arrow keys`, and the `spacebar` is used for almost everything else. 

Pressing `1`, `2`, `3` or `4` brings you to the respective stages. 

Progress is saved each time a stage is cleared. 

Pressing `\` erases all saved progress. 

Pressing `esc` while playing any stage brings up the pause menu.
